- [x] Instruction fetching from opcode
- [x] 0xCB prefixed instruction fetching
- [x] Cycle counting
- [x] Create a separate memory class that allows bank switching and a more accurate databus
- [x] Graphics (mostly done for dmg)
- [x] Raw `Memory` read and write functions for debugging
- [x] Finish debugger (Add more commands)
- [x] Control execution speed (can lock it at 60fps for now)
- [ ] Break up `Memory` class
- [ ] Abandon cycle counting, revert back to monke and get accurate-ish timing
- [ ] Create all encompassing `Gameboy` class to hold `CPU`, `PPU`, and `Memory` objects (Look at `Debugger` for inspiration)
- [ ] Documentation and useful comments (there are comments of dubious value all over)
- [ ] Touch up python tools to always generate usable code
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] C++-ify (SFML 3.0 requires C++17)
- [ ] Add command to dump framebuffer or screenshot
- [ ] Robust `PPU` frame debugger
